        <em>Method</em>
        <br>
        1. To prepare the dough, sift the flour with 1tsp of salt into a mixing bowl. Slowly mix in as much of the water is required, until a stiff dough is formed. Knead on a clean work surface for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is elastic and shiny. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for about an hour. 
        <br>
        2. Put the chopped lamb, onions, chilli, 1 tsp salt, pepper and spices in a bowl and mix thoroughly. 
        <br>
        3. Divide the dough into 4 small balls, and roll out to a thickness of 1.5mm, cutting into 10cm squares. Into each square, place 1 heaped teaspoon of the lamb mixture.
        <br>
        4. Take two opposite corners and bring them to join in the centre by nipping together firmly between your fingers, and then bring together to other two corners in the same manner. Note that the mantu should not be entirely closed, as the steam has to be penetrate and cook the filling!
        <br>
        5. Using fat to grease the shelves of the steamer, place your mantu so that there is a small space between each one. Steam for 30-45 minutes over a medium heat. 
        <br>
        6. Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Heat the oil in a pan, add tomato puree, and bring to the boil. Stir and simmer on a low heat until the mantu are ready.
        <br>
        7. Remove the mantu carefully from the steamer and place on a large, warm dish. Spoon the tomato sauce over the top, followed by the strained yoghurt, and sprinkle with chopped coriander to garnish. </p>

        <p>
            Directions
            <br>
            1 : Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and wash in between the layers.
            <br>
            Very thinly slice the white and light green portions of the leeks. The thinner you can slice this the better.
            <br>
            2 : In a large strainer over a bowl, combine the leeks, oil, and salt.
            <br>
            Mix together using your hands, massaging to ensure the leeks are well coated. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes to soften.
            <br>
            3 : Using your hands, squeeze the mixture to strain any excess liquid, and then add the green onions,
            <br>
            chili powder, and pepper over top the leeks. Mix and set aside.
            <br>
            4 : To make the yogurt sauce, combine the yogurt, garlic, mint, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
            <br>
            5 : To make the gheymeh, heat the oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Cook the onions until golden, about 5 minutes.
            <br>
            6 : Add the garlic, chili pepper, coriander, paprika, salt, and pepper and stir for 1 minute to toast.
            <br>
            7 : Add the veggie ground, water, and tomato paste. Mix and cook until heated through,
            <br> 
            about 4 - 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and keep covered with a lid.
            <br>
            8 : To make the aushak, take a wrapper, place 1 Tbsp of filling in the center.
            <br> 
            Wet the edges with some water and fold the wrapper in half, over the filling.
            <br>
            9 : Use your fingers to press out any extra air from the filling pocket and firmly pinch the edges to ensure the aushak is well sealed.
            <br>
            10 : Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 - 2 Tbsp oil to the water to help keep the aushak from sticking to each other.
            <br> 
            Working in batches, gently drop about 10 aushak in the water but don't overcrowd the pot. Cook for 4 - 5 minutes.
            <br>
            11 : Scoop out the cooked aushak and place in a lightly greased colander. Bring the pot of water back to a boil,
            <br>
            and continue to cook the remaining aushak.
            <br>
            12 : To serve, smear a couple of spoonfuls of yogurt on a few serving dishes. Place 1 - 2 layers of the cooked aushak on top.
            <br>
            13 : Cover the aushak with some more yogurt and gheymeh. Continue this process over several serving dishes.
            <br>
            14 : Garnish with fresh mint or cilantro, and enjoy!

        <p>
            <strong>Instructions</strong>
            <br>
            1 : Put the red onion in a juicer and separate the juice from the
            ground pulp. Keep it aside.
            <br>
            2 : Take a medium sized bowl and add freshly prepared onion juice,
            <br>
            crushed garlic, yogurt (if using), salt, pepper and cilantro. Mix all the ingredients well.
            <br>
            3 : Add the lamb and lamb fat or oil in the bowl. Combine all the ingredients properly to marinate the meat.
            <br>
            Keep the marinated meat in the refrigerator for 5-6 hours or overnight. Make sure that the bowl is covered the entire time.
            <br>
            4 : Next preheat the grill. Thread the lamb on to the skewers. If you are using the lamb fat,
            <br>
            keep in mind to alternate the meat cubes with the fat.
            <br>
            5 : Grill for approximately 15 to 20 minutes until the meat turns brown
            <br>
            in color and is properly cooked. Remember to turn the skewers frequently while grilling so the meat is cooked well from all sides.
            <br>
            6 : Now, take a large plate and place the lawausha or chapati on it. 
            <br>
            Separate the meat cubes from the skewers and transfer them onto the bread.
            <br>
            7 : Sprinkle a little bit of salt and pepper on top of the meat and then garnish it with the tomato, onion and lemon.
            <br>
            8 : Next fold the chapati or lawausha over. This will help to keep the meat inside warm. If there is any extra lawausha or chapati left,
            <br> 
            you can simply cut it into pieces and serve separately. You can also add mixed salad if you like.
