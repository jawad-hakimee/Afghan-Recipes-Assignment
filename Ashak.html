            Directions
            <br>
            1 : Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and wash in between the layers.
            <br>
            Very thinly slice the white and light green portions of the leeks. The thinner you can slice this the better.
            <br>
            2 : In a large strainer over a bowl, combine the leeks, oil, and salt.
            <br>
            Mix together using your hands, massaging to ensure the leeks are well coated. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes to soften.
            <br>
            3 : Using your hands, squeeze the mixture to strain any excess liquid, and then add the green onions,
            <br>
            chili powder, and pepper over top the leeks. Mix and set aside.
            <br>
            4 : To make the yogurt sauce, combine the yogurt, garlic, mint, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
            <br>
            5 : To make the gheymeh, heat the oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Cook the onions until golden, about 5 minutes.
            <br>
            6 : Add the garlic, chili pepper, coriander, paprika, salt, and pepper and stir for 1 minute to toast.
            <br>
            7 : Add the veggie ground, water, and tomato paste. Mix and cook until heated through,
            <br> 
            about 4 - 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and keep covered with a lid.
            <br>
            8 : To make the aushak, take a wrapper, place 1 Tbsp of filling in the center.
            <br> 
            Wet the edges with some water and fold the wrapper in half, over the filling.
            <br>
            9 : Use your fingers to press out any extra air from the filling pocket and firmly pinch the edges to ensure the aushak is well sealed.
            <br>
            10 : Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 - 2 Tbsp oil to the water to help keep the aushak from sticking to each other.
            <br> 
            Working in batches, gently drop about 10 aushak in the water but don't overcrowd the pot. Cook for 4 - 5 minutes.
            <br>
            11 : Scoop out the cooked aushak and place in a lightly greased colander. Bring the pot of water back to a boil,
            <br>
            and continue to cook the remaining aushak.
            <br>
            12 : To serve, smear a couple of spoonfuls of yogurt on a few serving dishes. Place 1 - 2 layers of the cooked aushak on top.
            <br>
            13 : Cover the aushak with some more yogurt and gheymeh. Continue this process over several serving dishes.
            <br>
            14 : Garnish with fresh mint or cilantro, and enjoy!
