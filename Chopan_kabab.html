            <strong>Instructions</strong>
            <br>
            1 : Put the red onion in a juicer and separate the juice from the
            ground pulp. Keep it aside.
            <br>
            2 : Take a medium sized bowl and add freshly prepared onion juice,
            <br>
            crushed garlic, yogurt (if using), salt, pepper and cilantro. Mix all the ingredients well.
            <br>
            3 : Add the lamb and lamb fat or oil in the bowl. Combine all the ingredients properly to marinate the meat.
            <br>
            Keep the marinated meat in the refrigerator for 5-6 hours or overnight. Make sure that the bowl is covered the entire time.
            <br>
            4 : Next preheat the grill. Thread the lamb on to the skewers. If you are using the lamb fat,
            <br>
            keep in mind to alternate the meat cubes with the fat.
            <br>
            5 : Grill for approximately 15 to 20 minutes until the meat turns brown
            <br>
            in color and is properly cooked. Remember to turn the skewers frequently while grilling so the meat is cooked well from all sides.
            <br>
            6 : Now, take a large plate and place the lawausha or chapati on it. 
            <br>
            Separate the meat cubes from the skewers and transfer them onto the bread.
            <br>
            7 : Sprinkle a little bit of salt and pepper on top of the meat and then garnish it with the tomato, onion and lemon.
            <br>
            8 : Next fold the chapati or lawausha over. This will help to keep the meat inside warm. If there is any extra lawausha or chapati left,
            <br> 
            you can simply cut it into pieces and serve separately. You can also add mixed salad if you like.
